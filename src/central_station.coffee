		###
		Lines get arranged star-like around the central node.
		Each line has a star point.
		
		Lines have three kinds of nodes: hi, lo and other.
		Lo nodes are nodes with degree one and are on the star point.
		Hi nodes are nodes with degree bigger one and are on the star point.
		Other nodes are nodes with degree bigger one and are on another star
		point.
		
		On which star point get nodes with degree bigger one?
		This is based on a balancing process. Each star point gets so many
		hi nodes such that it is balanced with each other star point as good as
		it gets.

			### Balancing # XXX not perfect I believe @payload
			Balancing is done in two phases. First it is counted such that
			each line gets a balanced amount of hi nodes. Second each node
			is assigned to a lines hi nodes. This ensures the sorting order
			of the kanjis which results in a good edge network with minimal
			connecting nodes. (Connecting nodes are nodes where an edge changes
			star points.)
